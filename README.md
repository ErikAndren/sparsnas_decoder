This is a decoder for IKEA SPARSNÃ„S.

It uses RTL-SDR running on a Raspberry Pi to demodulate the FSK signal, and decodes the packet.

Note: The packet data is encrypted using your sender's ID. I have yet to figure out how to reliably determine the sender ID, so unless you know your sender ID this project might be of limited use.
